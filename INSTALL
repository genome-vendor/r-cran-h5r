INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE h5r R PACKAGE

Currently, this package works and has been tested with hdf5-1.8.4 on
Mac OSX and Linux. The package will most likely work on most POSIX
systems where R works. Windows support should be forthcoming and
anyone who has experience there and would like to help please contact
me: jbullard@pacificbiosciences.com. 

To install, a working hdf5 installation must exist. This can be
downloaded at: http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html#hdf5

If the hdf5 libraries and header files are installed in standard
places (/usr, /usr/local) then the configure script should pick them
up and have no problem. If you have not installed hdf5 in a standard
place, but instead installed it in HDF5_HOME then you can install the
R package in the following way:

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="--with-hdf5=$HDF5_HOME" h5r

If you install to a non-standard location like this, then you must set
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to contain the directory:
$HDF5_HOME/libs, otherwise, at run-time, there will be no means to
find the hdf5.so. 

Please contact jbullard@pacificbiosciences.com if you have any
questions.
